# Github Branch Command

# Create
# git checkout -b "feature-branch"

# Read
# git branch # list all branches locally

# Delete
# git branch -D "feature-branch"

# change branch
# git checkout 




# Github Undo Command

# Git reset <filename>
# Git reset HEAD~1 # by default soft delete

# git reset --soft HEAD~5
# Effect: Moves HEAD to the commit 5 steps back but does not change the working directory or the index.
# Result: All changes from the last 5 commits will be staged. The working directory will still reflect the most recent state before the reset, but all changes from those 5 commits will be in the staging area.
# Git reset â€“hard HEAD~1

# undo git reset command
# git reflog # git running command history
# git reset "HEAD@{num}"
